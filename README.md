## 💬 About The Project
My motivation for writing this project was to expand my knowledge of working with data.
Thanks to this project I gained knowledge about data design and organized. It was a big challenge with many errors and a lot of knowledge.
  
Dashboard App is a project that helps you visualize sales statistics using tables, charts, diagrams and statistics.
In the project I used Material UI and Material UI Data Grid. I feel comfortable in this library and it's nice to work in it.
I also used Nivo, a library that visualizes diagrams,charts, maps and other things related to statistics and data organized.
I learned a lot about React Redux and how to use it in this project.The hardest part of the project was working with the backend controller logic. It was a dose of a lot of knowledge for me and a lot of time spent reading the documentation and looking for new solutions.
